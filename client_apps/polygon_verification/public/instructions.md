## Overview

We are collecting a dataset of text in natural images. In this dataset, each word should be annotated by a polygon that tightly surrounds it. We have some existing annotations. Your job is to judge these annotations.

You will shown a grid of cards, each an annotation. Click on the cards to mark them as correct (green) or wrong (red). Submit after marking all cards.

NOTE: At this point, most of the annotations are rectangles.


## What annotations are correct?

An annotation is correct if the polygon tightly surrounds the word. Below are some correct examples
